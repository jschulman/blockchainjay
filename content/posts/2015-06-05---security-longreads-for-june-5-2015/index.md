description: Dive into this week's Security Longreads, exploring the OPM breach linked
  to Anthem, Netflix's security in agile development, insights on the CISO's role,
  and a review of Google Photo's data-mining features.

**Commentary:** The big news (as of yesterday) is the breach of the US’s Office of Personnel Management. I’ve included the first article which ties the OPM breach to Anthem’s breach. I’m sure there is more to come. Netflix is known for their agile development but I’ve included a story on how they build security into their processes. Finally, two articles on the state of the CISO.

In Other Reads, the benefits of being weird and a review of Google Photo’s new photo data-mining.
