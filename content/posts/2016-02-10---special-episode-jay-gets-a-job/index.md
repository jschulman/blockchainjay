I’m taking a break from our regularly scheduled podcast to talk about my hunt for a new job.

I left Cigital in December and set off on a job search to find my next great opportunity.

In this week’s special episode, I walk through the entire job search process from talking with recruiters to tips and tricks in searching for a job.

What did I miss? I told you the things that were top of mind to me. What would you like to know more about? Again, my hope is that my experiences (and the experiences of all of the guests) help you in your career.
