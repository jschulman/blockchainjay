It’s been a few weeks since I’ve written a blog post. Tomorrow marks the end — election day — for my campaign for School Board. (Read about why I think everyone should run for elected office [here](https://www.jayschulman.com/im-running-office/).)

#### Something’s Gotta Give

Early on in the campaign, a fellow candidate came up to me and said “How do you get it all done?” I said I was getting less sleep. But as I thought more about it, I prioritized my life. My day job and my family were at the top. The election was just a short sprint to tomorrow. But things like this website took a back seat. I set a goal early on that I would post at jayschulman.com at least once per week, ideally twice.

#### Not Everything Gets Done and That’s OK

As the clock strikes 10p (or whatever time you consider a good time to go to bed), you have to weigh all of your priorities and determine whether you should go to sleep or keep up with the task list. For me, I’m happier that I got a full nights sleep by skipping a blog post (and skipping some home improvement tasks). In fact, I’m guessing I’m better at work and a better father when I’m not cranky from lack of sleep.

#### Keep The Fun Too

It can’t all be work, work, work. Throughout March, I still had Friday night date nights with my wife (order in and watch Netflix). And I snuck in a Spring Break trip to a waterpark. Each of these tasks was rejuvenating for me. I’m again more effective after relaxing in front of House of Cards (no, I haven’t finished this season yet). That said, watching the entire season in a weekend is probably not time well spent if you’re short on time.

March was my month for reaching my limits. The results come in Tuesday night. No matter what happens, I’ll keep writing at jayschulman.com.
