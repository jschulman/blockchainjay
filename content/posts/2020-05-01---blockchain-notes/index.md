#### Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it

That quote has been on the bottom of this site since I set it up.  (Ferris Bueller's Day Off, FYI).  Blockchain has that same feel.  It's moving so fast that it is hard to see the forest from the trees some days.

This "Notes" section of the website will hopefully contain blockchain notes -- not really well written blog posts -- but short thoughts of the day that hopefully will help you just as much help me document the fast moving blockchain space.
