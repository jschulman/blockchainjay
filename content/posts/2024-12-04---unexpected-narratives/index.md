description: Exploring the transformative narratives that emerge in crypto market cycles, from ICOs to NFTs, and speculating on the potential breakthrough trend of 2025.
---

Every major crypto bull run has its defining moment - a breakthrough narrative that no one sees coming until it suddenly dominates the conversation. As we enter 2024, I've been reflecting on how these transformative shifts tend to emerge in Q1, completely reshaping the landscape and capturing mainstream imagination.

Looking back, 2017 saw the explosive rise of ICOs, while 2021 was dominated by NFTs. What's fascinating is that very few people predicted NFTs would become the dominant narrative just months before their breakthrough. These movements succeed because they pull in new audiences and transcend the traditional crypto bubble, tapping into broader cultural moments.

As we look ahead to 2025, there's growing speculation about AI being the next big narrative. While AI certainly has potential, the key factor will be accessibility and relatability for newcomers to the space.

I believe the focus needs to be on reducing friction for new users. Recent developments like the Coinbase-Apple Pay integration hint at a future where entering the crypto ecosystem becomes dramatically simpler - imagine one-click solutions that let newcomers participate in staking and other DeFi activities without navigating multiple complex steps.
