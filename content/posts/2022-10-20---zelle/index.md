Zelle is the market leader in P2P payments?

This is a great example of our biases or personal experiences influencing broader trends.  I use Zelle a ton but I felt like I was the exception. A lot more Venmo and CashApp in my circle of friends.

Don't use any of these 3 apps?  You're probably going to struggle with understanding the broader disruption happening in the payments ecosystem.

Most importantly, stablecoins can be very disruptive to this marketplace.  It's no wonder than Stripe is starting to support USDC on their platform.

Understanding innovation and disruption is about understanding what others do more than what you do yourself.
