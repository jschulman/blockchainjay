I’m spending a lot of time this week thanking you (see Monday’s post [here](https://www.jayschulman.com/thank-you-2015/)).

In this week’s bonus podcast episode, I walk through some interesting statistics from the podcast so far. In two weeks, I’ll feature a special Masterclass episode of Season 1 featuring all of the podcast guests’ highlights compressed into 30 minutes.

Thank you again for listening to the podcast.
