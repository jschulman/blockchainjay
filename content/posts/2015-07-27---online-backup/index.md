Looking to backup your computers to a secure online storage solution? I use [CrashPlan](https://www.code42.com/crashplan/).

Code42 regards data security as the most important component of CrashPlan backup services. Data security and privacy concerns are addressed by employing a multi-layered security model that includes transmission security, account security (access), password security, encryption security and secure messaging.
